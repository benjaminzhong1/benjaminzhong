        <p>"Ben, what exactly is computer science?", my brother-in-law asked me this once over christmas dinner. To say the least, I was a deer caught in front of the headlights of a giant 18 wheeler in the form of a wakeup-call. 
            "What IS computer science?", I thought to myself. "What IS this field that I've been learning about?"
            "It's the study of computers, Johnny" was the best answer that I could come up with. 
            What followed after was a throw up of me naming algorithms and datastructures; what they do and how they work which had everyone further confused. 
            And if you haven't realized by now, I didn't know I was talking about. 
            Yes I knew how to program, and how recursion works, and I could build you a fully trained ml system but did I really know the meaning behind the work I do? Another topic was brought up and the conversation moved on. I ask myself this question everyday. 
            Do I really know the meaning of what I do? How DO computers work? It's a string of 1 and 0s of course. "What do 1s and 0s have to do with anything?" "What's a string? Some twine?"
